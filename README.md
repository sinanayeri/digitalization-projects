# Digitalization Projects

This repository contains digitalization and data projects with a strong focus on **Power BI**, **data modeling**, and **business-oriented analytics**.

The goal is to demonstrate how structured data, clean models, and well-defined KPIs can support operational and process-driven decision-making.

---

## Focus Areas

- Power BI dashboards for operational reporting
- Data modeling (star schema, relational models)
- Data quality checks and validation
- DAX measures and KPI design
- Process and digitalization-oriented analytics

## Repository Structure

This repository uses a **data-lake style structure**.

Raw data, processed data, and reporting assets are intentionally kept separate and organized by **data stage** and **project**, rather than being grouped inside a single project folder.

### Structure Overview:

- `data/raw/<project>/`  
  Raw, unmodified source data as ingested from systems or exports

- `data/processed/<project>/`  
  Cleaned and validated datasets used for reporting and analysis

- `powerbi/<project>/`  
  Power BI dashboards, models, and project-specific documentation

### Example

data/raw/ProjectX/
data/processed/ProjectX/
powerbi/ProjectX-dashboard/
